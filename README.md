# 💻 Laptop Request Catalog Item – ServiceNow Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on designing and implementing a **Laptop Request Service Catalog Item** in ServiceNow.  

The goal is to provide employees with a quick, structured, and user-friendly way to request laptops through an automated Service Catalog workflow instead of manual request handling.

The solution includes dynamic form behavior using **UI Policies and UI Actions**, ensuring accurate data collection, better user guidance, and improved service governance.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Employees in the organization need a quick and efficient way to request laptops for work.  

The current process is manual and prone to delays, with no dynamic form behavior to guide users or ensure accurate data collection.

To address this, a **Service Catalog Item** needs to be created that:

- Allows users to easily request a laptop  
- Uses dynamic fields for guided input  
- Provides clear instructions  
- Includes additional functionality like form reset  
- Ensures all changes are tracked using Update Sets for governance
